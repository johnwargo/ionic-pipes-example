# Ionic Pipes Sample

While working on an Ionic project, I needed to create a custom Pipe that formatted my data in a certain way for presentation. In my case, it was an array of objects that I wanted to display in a view as a comma-separated list.

In looking around, I couldn't find a complete example (end to end) that showed how to do what I wanted. I followed a tutorial or two, each which took a different approach, and simply couldn't get it working. I finally asked on the Ionic Forums and got the solution I needed. I created this project to highlight the solution to help others in the same situation.
